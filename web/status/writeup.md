There's a bug in the auth - if a token, username, and product ID are all provided, and the token and username match, the server doesn't check that the user has access to the product, and simply lets you through.

Thus, you can get the private status of the "Five Nines Service" by navigating to `/admin/Five-Nines-Service` to get the product id from the webpage source, then fetching `/get_private_status?username=<your username>&product_id=<product id>`.
