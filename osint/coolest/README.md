# The Coolest Thing I've Ever Done

When we was in college, my wife and I found a critical vulnerability in a widely-used software. The exploit we used was heavily based off of the blog post of another hacker. What is the 3-word name of that exploit, and the name of that hacker?

The flag is the exploit name, then the hacker name, separated by underscores and all lowercase. Example flag: `tctf{exploit_name_here_firstname_lastname}`
