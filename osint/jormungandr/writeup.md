"Jormungandr" is a reversing challenge that I wrote for [ImaginaryCTF 2022](https://2022.imaginaryctf.org/Challenges.html) with the exact same description and attachment. Googling the challenge description in quotes or `jormungandr "ictf"` pulls up [this Japanese writeup](https://nanimokangaeteinai-hateblo-jp.translate.goog/entry/2022/07/21/200947?_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc#Reversing-474-Jormungandr-18-solves) for the challenge, which contains the flag.
